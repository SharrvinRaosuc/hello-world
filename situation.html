        <p>Southern University College (also known as Southern UC) attained  its current status in 2012. It was previously known as Southern College -  established in 1990 as the first non-profit institute of higher-education in  Malaysia to provide a local educational channel for high school graduates who  were unable to further their studies in foreign countries or gain admission to  other local tertiary educational institutions.</p>
        <p>Historically, Southern UC has its origin 46 years ago (in 1975) in  Foon Yew High School, Johor Bahru, offering an Advanced Studies Programme. In  1986, the Foon Yew Board of Directors applied to the Ministry of Education to  set up a community funded college. Through the persistent effort of the Chinese  community leaders, approval was subsequently obtained from the Ministry of  Education in 1990 for the establishment of Southern College.</p>
        <p>Southern UC is located in the Skudai area of Johor Bahru, Malaysia  - an area within the Iskandar Malaysia Economic Zone. Its campus land is sized  at 33 acres, mainly donated by philanthropist Mr. Seow Wan Heong. Following the  development of Iskandar Malaysia Economic Zone, Southern UC will be one of the  important educational institutions in Malaysia, and has poised itself to become  an international educational institution. The Southern UC campus is a scenic  spot, rich in Chinese traditional colours and a multicultural atmosphere that  encompasses the spirit of co-existence and multi-culturism.</p>
        <p>Currently, Southern UC has 6 faculties, 3 schools, and 4 research  institutes. The 6 Faculties include Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences,  Faculty of Business and Management, Faculty of Art and Design, Faculty of  Engineering and Information Technology, Faculty of Chinese Medicine and Faculty  of Education and Psychology. The 3 schools comprised School of Foundation  Studies, School of Professional &amp; Continuing Education and Southern  Institute of Technical Education. The 4 research institutes include Institute  of Graduate Studies and Research, Research Institute of Chinese Ethnicity &amp;  Culture, Malaysian Chinese Literature Centre and Research Institute of Malay  Language and Culture. </p>
        <p>Southern UC is planning to become a full-fledged university by  2021, and aims to become a well-known International University by 2030.</p>
