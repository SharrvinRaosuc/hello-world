    <p>One of the primary roles of the Academic Affairs, Admission &amp; Registration Office of Southern University College is to coordinate and implement the course offerings of all programs.  The AARO office comprises three units: the information and data unit, the examination unit, and the course and timetable scheduling unit.  Each unit performs the specific tasks required of these academic activities.  Aside from providing the highest possible service and satisfaction to students, faculties, and customers, the AARO always strives to assist in the raising of the quality of teaching and learning.  This is in line with one of the main objectives of the University College, which is to become a University in the not too distant future.  To realize the goal of attaining higher academic standing, the AARO periodically reviews and amends academic matters, and works closely with the faculties and other academic administrators in planning and developing new programs, implementing academic policies, and providing a wider scope for career advancement.</p>
    <p>In addition to managing the University College own programs, the Academic Affairs, Admission &amp; Registration Office also co-ordinates and manages the courses of Twinning degree Programs with Teesside University (U.K.), University of Wales (U.K.) and Tianjin University of Chinese Medicine (China).</p>
